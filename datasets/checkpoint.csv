Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back. (You ain’t getting checks). Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back. Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back. D town LAX, every week I bounce back. If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back. . [Verse 2: Big Sean]. Look, I woke up in beast mode. With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though. Been top 5, these niggas sleep though. Only thing that sold out is the seats though (Never sold my soul, never will never have). Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority. If you fuck with my glory I'ma drop the L and get gory. I done did everything except worry. Hella drama, my life story. Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing. I knew that this life was meant for me. Niggas change up more than wishin' wells. Karma come around I'll wish 'em well. Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill. I kill the scene like I’m Denzel. Crazy like my jacket strapped up. Nigga I don’t act but I'll act up. Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up. Back, back, back, back up. Nigga I'ma need like 10 feet. Or get stomped out with ten feet. I'ma always lose my temper. You cannot “count to ten” me. If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5. Seen court rooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides. Nigga fuck what you know. Nigga I’m takin' back control. The under dog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows. Yeah, I call shots while you call off. Never takin' summer or fall off. When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off. . [Hook: Big Sean].

I wish we could trade shoes or we could change lives. So we could understand each other more but that'd take time. I'm not racist. . It's like we livin' in the same buildin' but splittin' the both sides. I'm not racist. But there's two sides to every story and now you know mine. . Can't erase the scars with a bandage.

Laughter. I see these haters looking at me like I owe them something. You looking bad I prolly throw you something. I see you flexing with that money and I know you frontin'. I caught cases never told 'em nothing. Got all these chains and this change on me. Niggas said I changed man they changed on me. Man it ain't a thang everything on me. Man a see a clear port plane on me. . You see me coming around your corner lookin' like I got a check. Flew into your city me my niggas on the jet. Ballin' every time I take a shot I hit the net. And everyday niggas want the money for respect. I ain't trippin' I got money, clothes, car, hoes. Shoppin' 'til the mall close. Lord knows, I could fit a brick up in these cargos. I don't fuck with niggas cause they all told. Worry 'bout another nigga money like they all hoes. I'm just with my niggas spining hella blocks. Bad bitch on all my banshee I'm like twelve o' clock.

And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on. I can't even capture the feeling I had at first. Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works. The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse. Their actions out of character even when they rehearse. Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave. I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place. Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved. And they don't like that, it's written all on they face.

Most times it's just somebody that's underage. That's probably just alone and afraid. And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain.

That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is. I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome. Then she finally got to Rome. And all she did was post pictures for people at home. 'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known. I know another girl that's cryin' out for help. But her latest caption is ""Leave me alone"". I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone. I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown. To post later and make it look like she still on the go. Look at the way we live. I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world. I was hidin' the world from my kid. From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate. Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate. Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs. The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call. They always ask, ""Why let the story run if it's false?"". You know a wise man once said nothin' at all. I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend. All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch. All these followers but, who gon' follow me to the end?. I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then. . You've got me fe–.

I'm balling, you can't stand it how I keep you on your toes. No motion picture money rewinds in my video. When I'm in my city, I feel like I'm Rambo. My bro like a mechanic, always keep the hammer close. Do I believe in heaven? To be honest, I don't know. But I believe in Ghosts and I believe in Lambo's. .

Just wakin' up in the mornin' gotta thank God. I don't know but today seems kinda odd. No barkin' from the dog, no smog. And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog. (Damn). I got my grub on, but didn't pig out. Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out. (Whassup?). Hooked it up for later as I hit the do'. Thinkin' will I live another twenty-fo'. I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop top. . And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop. Had to stop, at a red light. Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight. And everything is alright. I got a beep from Kim and she can fuck all night. Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all. Which park, are y'all playin' basketball?. Get me on the court and I'm trouble. Last week fucked around and got a triple double. Freakin' niggaz everyway like M.J. I can't believe, today was a good day. (Shit!). . Drove to the pad and hit the showers. Didn't even get no static from the cowards. 'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me. Saw the police and they rolled right past me. No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction. As I ran the intersection. Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' yo! MTV Raps. What's the haps on the craps?. . Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em. Roll 'em in a circle of niggaz and watch me break 'em. With the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven. Seven even back do' Lil' Joe. I picked up the cash flow. Then we played bones, and I'm yellin' domino. Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A. Today was a good day. (Shit!). . Left my nigga's house paid. (What). Picked up a girl been tryin' to fuck since the 12th grade. It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic. The lakers beat the Supersonics. I felt on the big fat fanny. Pulled out the jammy and killed the punanny. And my dick runs deep, so deep. So deep put her ass to sleep. Woke her up around one. She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun. Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'. Took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion. . I was glad everything had worked out. Dropped her ass off and then chirped out. Today was like one of those fly dreams. Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams. No helicopter looking for a murder. Two in the mornin' got the Fatburger. Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp. And it read, ""Ice Cube's a pimp"". (Yeah). Drunk as hell but no throwin' up. Half way home and my pager still blowin' up. Today I didn't even have to use my A.K. I got to say it was a good day. (Shit!). . Hey wait, wait a minute Pooh, stop this shit. What the fuck I'm thinkin' about?</p>",Best Hip-Hop Playlist

Peanut butter guts inside it. 26 inch big body. I just got the fingernails polished. Hoe ass niggas can't ride with. Miss me with the lame ass logic. Pretty little bitch she a goddess. Booty on the bounce like dry [?]. Count that guap with the gang. Niggas selling out for the fame. Need a little hand sanitizer, I can't shake hands with a lame. So full of grace, keep the clean in your face. For the sake of the pesos. Man I got young bulls in the field, when the problem appears they arrive with the dracos. I been covered in the blood with the halo. I've been stepping on the scene looking fuego. I been losing more friends as the days go. Me and Queen getting lit like fable. I been doing my thing for a long long time. Hating there's a long long line. Rari nigga going world wide. You and your niggas look tired. . Came with the posse. Chain looking ocky. Ice with the hockey. Playing in the Mazzi'. Playing with a bitch and her friend on the molly. Playing with the bands. Dope like I'm playing with the pan. Young god high in demand. Got a lot of shots in the can. Real niggas recognize real. You never been in that field. Yeen' bring nothing to the table. Yeen' gettin none of my mills</p>",Best Hip-Hop Playlist

Change is one of the most difficult things that we face, but change is inevitable.. One reason we don't like change is we get comfortable where we are. We get used. to our friends, our job, the place we live, and even if it's not perfect we accept. it because it's familiar. What happens is because we're not willing to change, we. get stuck in what God used to do instead of moving forward into what God is about. to do. Just because God's blessed you where you are doesn't mean you can just sit. back and settle there. You have to stay open to what God is doing now. What worked. five years ago may not work today. If you're going to be successful you have to. be willing to change. Every blessing is not supposed to be permanent. Every provision. is not supposed to last forever. We should constantly evaluate our friendships.. Who's speaking into your life? Who are you depending on? Make sure they're not dragging. you down, limiting you from blossoming. Everybody is not supposed to be in our life. forever. If you don't get rid of the wrong friends you will never meet the right. friends</p>",Best Hip-Hop Playlist

I told them before don't bring up my past, i might kill myself. Never told a soul all the pain I've been coping with. I've been on my own, get the fuck up out my face bitch. Better give me one good reason not to tear your limbs. You don't know my mother fucking story and you don't know shit. So stuck that you can't move. Really thinking that you're hurt 'cus you want to. I've been putting in the work like i got to. Big dreams in your head are they not true. Dont you let these mother fuckers try stop you. Don't be a bitch get it like its not hard to. Get up and get it then. Harm your affiliates. Show me your hell in your present tense. I put the terror in resonance. Never told a soul all the pain I've been coping with. I've been on my own, get the fuck up out my face bitch. Better give me one good reason not to tear your limbs.

How your life could be before you met me. Don't wait, G. I meant you, and your little sister too. I broke in ya house and blew chunks in the room. Now look at that, I'm chillin' in ya mama's bubble bath. Relaxin'. Chewin' on a shitty used napkin. I must've mistook it for ya grandma's tits. She's into zippers and whips. I'm talkin' freaky deaky shit, bitch. tourture you with gutter tubes. And throw you like rubbish. Tie up all your limbs and then control you like a puppet. The bitches love it - putting cocaine in a bucket. Serve it to the pigs and watch'em cause a bunch of ruckus. (Oh, I'ts like that?). Well kiss my mother fucking ass crack, bitch. And tell ya dad I want my adderall back, bitch. I'll play you like monopoly, destroy your property,. I got a pocket full of pills so please prepare properly. Because I am the one who is next up. Hit you with the uppercut. Slam dunkin' in ya chick's guts. T, E double R, O to the R. Speedin' down ya block in a stolen cop car,. Because I am the one who is next up. Hit you with the BMX X-Up. You better pucker up and kiss my gluteus. I'm not that new to this. Terror taking over coming straight out the mothafuckin'. looney bin. I got the spastic tactics and unique techniques. I'm Godzilla up in the streets, and king kong in the sheets. Take our way just to recover. I slice the booty cheeks like butter. Then I nut under ya covers. I used to fuck the pussy during math class. Now I fuck the pussy or the tushy while im driving real fast. R-E-I-D, he got a rare disease. And grabbin' a gun that shoots mothafuckin' laser beams. You know, anything is possible with these secret unlockables. Unstoppable- gettin' head from Kim possible. And Ron's in the back, with his naked mole rat. Give him a hit of acid, and a DVD of Rugrats. What's the stich?. Are ya hearin' this shit?. That im spillin out my lips as I'm pullin' on some whippets. Just sit back, relax, and pay attention. The masked maniac is back and stole ya grandfather's whole pension. Because I am the one who is next up. Hit you with the uppercut. Slam dunkin' in ya chick's guts. T, E double R, O to the R. Speedin' down ya block in a stolen cop car. Because I am the one who is next up. Hit you with the BMX X-Up. You better pucker up and kiss my gluteus. I'm not that new to this.

Screaming out, ""Why bother"". My ex-bitch too bad, my next bitch way hotter. We met in a car crash, she ride it like full throttle. . I'm not sure. I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure. Baby, you're not her. My last girl had me so fucked up it was a blacked out blur. Baby, you jump first. It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth. Baby, do your worst. I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first</p>",Best Hip-Hop Playlist

That get down for theirs. Constantly, money over bitches. Not bitches over money. . Stay on your grind, nigga. . My ambitions as a ridah. . My ambitions as a ridah. . So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars. . This life as a rap star is nothing without guard. Was born rough and rugged, addressing the mass public. My attitude was ""fuck it"" cause motherfuckers love it. To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease. Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be. Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah. To catch her while she hot and horny go up inside her. Then I spit some game in her ear, ""go to the telly, hoe"". Equipped with money in a Benz cause, bitch, I'm barely broke.

I got no time for these bitches cause these hoes try to play us. . I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mill, so I'm wishing. Competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressing. I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory. No guts no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted. Now it's on and it's on because I said so. Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row. Now these money hungry bitches getting suspicious. Started plotting and planning on schemes to come and trick us. But thug niggas be on point and game tight. . Me, Syke and Bogart strapped up the same night. Got problems then handle it, motherfuckers see me. These niggas is jealous. .

Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise. When it's time to ride. . I was the first off this side, give me the 9. I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life. . That's what they screaming as they drill me. . But I'm hard to kill (that's all you niggas got?). So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel. . Spitting at adversaries, envious and after me. . I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed. Mama, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinking thoughts. I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flying when I'm caught. (Shoot!) Fuck doing jail time, better day, sacrificing. Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson. Thugging for life, and if you right then nigga die for it. Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it. When it's time to die, to be a man. You pick the way you leave. . Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah. . I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah. You don't wanna fuck with me. Got the police bustin' at me. But they can't do nothing to a G. Let's get ready to rumble. . Equipped with spirits of the thugs before me. Pay off the block, evade the cops. Cause I know they coming for me. . I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years. Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears. Question my methods to switch up speeds. Sure as some bitches bleed. Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed. Blast me, but they didn't finish, (buck buck buck buck buck). Didn't diminish my powers. So now I'm back to be a motherfucking menace, they cowards. That's why they tried to set me up. Had bitch ass niggas on my team, so indeed they wet me up. But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated. At the time I contemplate the way that God made it. Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary. For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried. I been getting much mail in jail, niggas telling me to kill it. Knowing when I get out, they gon' feel it. Witness the realest. A hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside. The cry from all your people when they find her. Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic. Revenge on them niggas that played me. And all the cowards that was down with it. Now it's yo' nigga right beside ya.

I be that shadow hovering just like the shallow end bubbling up with blood and guts. I used to be known as a shark attack, but now I'm hot like the cherry on my bitch's blunt wrap. Because I am the wave. Yung Plague the hurricane. I am the wave as I crash on the shore flooding the trail you paved. Move out my way bitch, I'm making a stain. Bleach ain't the way to remove all the grey. Hating because I took the wind out of your sails. Now you're dried up and salty because I am the wave. I was the shipwreck, but then I sank. Full moon hope you don't cry wolf. High Tide in the Snake's Nest I'm the mongoose. Sunset you can see the blue sky dilute. As I blow another grey cloud. Hanging my noose. . [Verse 2: Yung Christ]. Fuck do you mean we not running the scene?. Took us only one year to be underground kings. Straight out of hell with the intent to sell. Y'all been doing this shit since the year 2012. Fuck do you mean when you say you don't see us. That grey that surrounds you created by Jesus. But Jesus is me I'm Yung Christ, I'm that leader. Better be careful when threading that needle. Word around town Lil Slick got a murder charge. Whipping cop cars while I'm gone off them Xanny bars. Don't you fucking reach for life. Bitch take this knife. Tape his mouth and cut the lights. Time for the last rites</p>",Best Hip-Hop Playlist

If you tried to inhabit my mind for a moment. You wouldn't, you shouldn't, you couldn't last seconds inside of it. I did it, I admit, I did it all knowing side-effects. Now my affliction's, I suffer from visions of things that were written. But my disposition is meaningless even if I know the sequences. King of the Demons, no stranger to weakness. I've studied the meaning of meanings. Been meaning to see what the reason is. Demon-strate, wait I mean. Demonstrate all of the anguish I feel through the ones that I vanquish. 'Cause I am the hated but lacking of hatred or any emotion, commotion, or chatter. Not that it matters, but I've got some matters to tend to. Depending on my mood. I might hit you back, but if not, don't be mad. Understand that I'm not obligated to respond if I am not interested. Or if I'm occupied, like all my time nowadays. See, it's great but the weight of the stress presses into my chest. Life keeps testing, I draw on the paper and don't give it back. I'm through helping out and I'm done giving back. And I can't hold it back. The frustation keeps taking away from the vague little patience my brain had mistakenly left in me. No turning back. It's out of the question. You can't disappoint me if I leave you anything short of expectancy. I am the Reaper, I only bring death. I don't even know what else you'd ever expect of me. . If there's a problem, you probably don't want a problem with me. XIII The Reaper, releasing the misery of the obscene. If there's a problem, you probably don't want a problem with me. XIII The Reaper, releasing the misery of the obscene. . Lapping and lapping and lapping and lapping around you with such repetition. I just brought it back, back for a second for just a few seconds. Concealing your fate with a message. 1080 HD and 1080 the wrist with my finger extended. See, OmenXIII is not shy of a menace. I am the half-hearted demi-god, nihilistic straight from the depths. I brought death and then I made a promise to myself. The misfit, continue to leave my surroundings as lifeless as the place I live. Now my perspectives grim and that's all it will ever be, all of eternity. Bitch, I've been certainly working with urgency. Hurting deservingly anyone irking me. I speak these words, leaving burns, exceed third degree. I stay inside but emerge for emergency. Currently, certainly, perfectly, serving a verse and conserving this currency. Worst of the worst is they say I'm a jerk. Yeah, I'm never concerned if you eat, if you breathe, what you think, what you see. So please don't take it personally, I am the reason you've been losing sleep. Can't keep counting these sheep and expect to see dreams. OmenXIII, still out of your reach.

You see with your eyes, I see destruction and demise. Corruption in disguise, from this fuckin' enterprise. Now I'm sucking to your lies. . Through russ, though not his muscles but the percussion he provides. With me as a guide, you all can see me now. 'Cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind. That's the inner, so I'm gonna stick around with russ and be a mentor. . With a few rhymes so mother fuckers, remember where the thought is. I brought all this, so you can survive when law is lawless. Feelings, sensations that you thought were dead. No squealing remember, that it's all in your head. . I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad, I got sunshine, in a bag. I'm useless, but not for long, the future is comin' on. I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad, I got sunshine, in a bag. I'm useless, but not for long, my future is comin' on. Is comin' on, is comin' on, is comin' on. Is comin' on, is comin' on. My future is comin' on. Is comin' on, is comin' on, is comin' on. Is comin' on, is comin' on. My future is comin' on. Is comin' on, is comin' on, is comin' on. Is comin' on, is comin' on. My future is comin' on. Is comin' on, is comin' on, is comin' on. My future is comin' on. Is comin' on, is comin' on. My future is comin' on. Is comin' on, is comin' on. My future</p>",Best Hip-Hop Playlist

Kinda broke so ya know all I got's five, I got five. . Player, give me some brew and I might just chill. But I'm the type that like to light another joint like Cypress Hill. I'm-a steal doobies, spit loogies when I puff on it. . I got some bucks on it but it ain't enough on it. Go get the S-t. I-d-e-s. Nevertheless I'm hella fresh, rolling joints like a cigarette. So pass it across the table like ping pong, I'm gone. . Beating my chest like King Kong. It's on wrap my lips around a 40. And when it comes to getting another stogie fools all kick in like Shinobi. No, he ain't my homie to begin with. . It's too many heads to be proper to let my friend hit it. Unless you pull out the fat, crispy. 5 dollar bill on the real before it's history. Cause fools be having them vacuum lungs. . An if you let em hit it for free you hella dum-da-dum-dumb. I come to school with the Taylor on my earlobe. Avoiding all the thick teasers, skeezers, and weirdos. That be blowing off the land like where the bomb at. . Give me two bucks, you take a puff and pass my bong back. Suck up the dank like a Slurpee. The serious bomb will make a niggy go delirious like Eddie Murphy. I got more Growing Pains than Maggie. . Cause homies nag me to take the dank out of the baggie. . I got five on it. . Grab your 40, let's get keyed. I got five on it. Messing with that Indo weed. I got five on it. . It's got me stuck and not go back. I got five on it. Partner lets go half on a sack. . I take sacks to the face whenever I can. Don't need no crutch, I'm so keyed up 'till the joint be burning my hand. Next time I roll it in a hampa. . To burn slow, so the ashes won't be burning up my hand, bro. Hoochies can hit but they know they got to pitch in. Then I roll a joint that's longer than your extension (hahaha). Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free. Hell no, you better bring your own spliff, chief. . What's up, don't babysit that better pass the joint. Stop hitting cause you know you got asthma. Crack a 40 open homie. And guzzle it, cause I know the weed in my system is getting lonely. . I gotta take a whiz test to my P-O. I know I failed cause I done smoked major weed bro. And every time we with Chris that fool rolling up a fatty. But the Tanqueray straight had me. . Hey, make this right man, stop at the light man. My yester-night thing got me hung off the night train. . You fade, I face, so let's head to the east. Hit the stroll to 9-0 so we can roll big hashish. I wish I could fade the eighth, but I'm low budget. Still rolling a two door Cutlass same old bucket. . Foggy windows, soggy Indoe. I'm in the 'land getting smoked wit my kinfolk. . Been smoked, Yuk'll spray ya, lay ya down up in the O-A-K the Town. Homies don't play around we down to blaze a pound. Then ease up, speed up through the E-S-O. Drink the V-S-O-P with a lemon squeeze up. And everybody's rolled up, I'm da roller. That's quick to fold a blunt out of a buncha sticky doja. Hold up, suck up my weed is all you do.

Represent, represent. . Straight up shit is real and any day could be your last in the jungle. Get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble. The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals. Who don't care, guzzling beers, we all stare. At the out-of-towners, they better break North. Before we get the four pounders and take their face off. The streets is filled with undercovers, homicide chasing brothers. The D's on the roof tryna watch us and knock us. And killer coppers, even come through in helicopters. I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock. For the fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners. Thinking it can't happen 'til I trap 'em and clap 'em. And leave 'em done, won't even run about Gods. I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards. Nas is a rebel of the street corner. . Pulling a Tec out the dresser, police got me under pressure. . Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella. Moet drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller. Who's always on the corner, rolling up blessed. When I dress, it's never nothing less than Guess. Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back. Love committing sins and my friends sell crack. This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue. The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one. Cause life ain't shit but stress, fake niggas, and crab stunts. So I guzzle my Hennesey while pulling on mad blunts. The brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator. The type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator. Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game. Used to sport Bally's and Cazals with black frames. . Now I'm into fat chains, sex and Tecs. Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heine's and Beck's. . No doubt, see my stacks are fat, this is what it's about. Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan. Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxxane. I used to wake up every morning, see my crew on the block. Every day's a different plan that had us running from cops. If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots. We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks. Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man. Fuck a yard God, let me see a hundred grand. Could use a gun son, but fuck being the wanted man. But if I hit rock bottom then I'mma be the Son of Sam. Then call the crew to get live too with Swoop, Bokeem. My brother Jungle, Big Bo, cooks up the blow. Mike'll chop it, Mayo, you count the profit. . My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it. It's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs. 'Nuff respect to the projects, I'm ghost, one love. . One time for your mothafuckin' mind. This goes out to everybody in New York. That's living the real fucking life and every projects, all over. To my man, Big Will he's still here. The 40 side of Vernon, my man Big L.E.S. Big Cee-Lo from the Don, Shawn Penn, the 40 busters. My crew the shorty busters, the 41st side of Vernon posse. The Goodfellas, my man Cormega, Lakey the Kid. Can't forget Draws, the Hillbillies. . My man Slate, Wallethead, Black Jay, Big Oogi. Crazy barrio spot, (Big Dove), we rock shit, Ph.D. And my man Primo, from Gang Starr. '94 real shit y'all, (word up Harry O), fuck y'all crab-ass niggas though. Bitch ass niggas (Bitch ass niggas, young bitch ass motherfuckers). Come to Queensbridge motherfucker! (yeah, yeah).
